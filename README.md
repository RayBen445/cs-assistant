## Technical Details

### Authentication Implementation
- User accounts managed through Firebase Authentication
- User profiles stored in Firebase Firestore with structure:
  ```json
  {
    "uid": "firebase-user-id",
    "username": "user-chosen-username", 
    "displayName": "User Display Name",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "isAdmin": false,
    "preferences": {
      "theme": "light",
      "accentColor": "#0078d4",
      "voice": "en-US"
    }
  }
  ```
- Admin status determined by username matching `RayBen445`
- Legacy localStorage migration on first Firebase login

### Data Storage
- **User Profiles**: Firebase Firestore `/users/{uid}` collection
- **Chat History**: `localStorage['chat-history']` (authenticated users only)
- **Goals**: `localStorage['goals']` (authenticated users only)  
- **Reminders**: `localStorage['reminders']` (authenticated users only)
- **Themes**: Per-user preferences in Firebase (authenticated users)
